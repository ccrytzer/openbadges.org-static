Community Calls

Running since 2012 in an almost unbroken weekly series, the Open Badges community call has been a great resource for the badges community. 

The community call occurs every Wednesday, with rare exceptions for holidays and special events. 60 minutes, starting at 12 pm ET / 9 am PT / 5pm BST / 4pm UTC (following US Daylight Saving Time adjustments). See the events calendar for upcoming calls. Join us on Wednesdays on our [audio channel](https://www.uberconference.com/badgealliance).

The Badge Alliance Operations Coordinator organizes and moderates the weekly calls and welcomes suggested topics. These calls are a great way to stay abreast of developments in the Open Badges ecosystem. Listen to presentations from invited experts on case studies and open questions in the world of Open Badges. Contribute to discussions identifying and prioritizing actions to move the Open Badges ecosystem forward. 

Slack

Members of the BA community idle in our official Slack channel. Communicate with the Badge Alliance community via Slack messenger, the BA’s instant messaging and communication system. Here, we exchange thoughts, ideas, questions, and documents to push toward our goals in the badge community.

Funding & Membership

The Badge Alliance receives its funding primarily from its member organizations, with additional support from direct grants. Collective Shift is the BA’s fiscal sponsor, providing a core piece of the annual budget and supporting key back-office capabilities.

Funding considerations for Open Badges

+ Staff (writers, designers, content experts)
+ Tech (software, services, other computing resources)
+ Operations (office, promotional, and logistics)
+ Events (conferences, hackathons, presentations, and key organizing opportunities)

Organizational Model

The Badge Alliance consists of a constellation of Working Groups made up of representatives from member organizations and is supported by a small internal staff. [The Constellation Model of Collaborative Social Change](http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&context=lien_research) by Tonya Surman & Mark Surman is a framework designed to support multi-organization partnerships and networks within complex systems. It’s a way to bring together multiple groups or sectors to work toward joint outcomes and serve social change.

Constellations of Working Groups enable networks to harness the power of loose coupling, connecting the right partners based on their own interests and assets. This creates stronger action teams that are harnessing the power of self-interest within a shared vision.

History of Open Badges

2010:

+ The Badge Alliance is an evolution of the work begun during the [2010 Mozilla Festival](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/events/Festival) (then, the “Mozilla Drumbeat Festival”) in Barcelona, under the banner "Learning, Freedom, and the Web". At this festival, [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), [P2PU](https://p2pu.org/en/), [DML](http://dmlcentral.net/), and [Remix Learning](http://remixlearning.com/) hosted a [Badge Lab](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/events/Festival/program/activities#Badge_lab) that invited participants to test, critique, and improve badges and tools that recognized informal online learning.

2011:

+ The fourth [Digital Media and Learning Competition](http://www.hastac.org/dml-competitions/2012) (2011-2013) provided up to $2 million in grants for 30 innovative badge systems and two research projects as part of the Badges for Lifelong Learning Competition, administered by [HASTAC](http://hastac.org/) and supported by the [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation](http://www.macfound.org/), with additional support from the [Gates Foundation](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/) and in partnership with the Mozilla Foundation.

2012:

+ In October 2012, Mozilla released the [Public Beta of the Open Badge Infrastructure](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2012/04/10/mozilla-open-badges-beta/), making the technical infrastructure supporting Open Badges publicly available for use.

2013:

+ Mozilla launched [Open Badges 1.0](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/03/14/open_badges/) at the 2013 Digital Media and Learning Conference, followed by a full launch of Mozilla Open Badges.

2014:

+ The Summit to Reconnect Learning, held in Silicon Valley, was the first event to focus on moving Open Badges from the edges of innovation to the mainstream. At the summit, a wave of business and education partners made public pledges committing to help accelerate the spread and scale of digital badges for learning, and the Badge Alliance Working Groups were soft-launched. Erin Knight, who had previously led the Open Badges project at Mozilla, was announced as Executive Director of the Badge Alliance.

2015:

+ 2014-2015 proved that the interest in verifiable, shareable, portable badges is strong. The partners focused on completing the ecosystem and identifying the problems that needed to be solved. This involved investigating the original core assumptions and weeding out practices that didn’t meet the needs of badge users. 

Today:

+ The Badge Alliance has a new set of technical resources and committed partners to ensure the right and complete ecosystem is built to enable the use cases first outlined by Erin Knight’s team at Mozilla and its first collaborators in 2011. 

+ Built on the success of a three-year demonstration project, the [Cities of LRNG network](https://www.lrng.org/) now includes 12 U.S. cities. In an effort to close the growing divide between young people who have access to 21st century opportunities and those who don't, LRNG Cities combine in-school, out-of-school, employer-based, and online learning experiences for youth ages 13-24. LRNG's new digital platform connects youth to customized badge-enabled playlists and pathways for relevant learning experiences, resources, and events.
